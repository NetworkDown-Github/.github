Welcome to the NetworkDown.info, We are a up and coming solution to network outages alerts.

## What is NetworkDown.info?

NetworkDown.info is a service that allows you to monitor your network for outages and alerts you when your network is down.
We are looking for beta testers to help us test our service and provide feedback.
Please feel free to contact us at [app.networkdown.info/signup](https://app.networkdown.info/signup), if you are interested in becoming a beta tester.

## How does NetworkDown.info work?

NetworkDown.info works by monitoring your network for outages. We use a combination of monitoring tools to check your network for outages, including onsite devices to monitor your network from the inside and external monitoring tools to monitor your network from the outside.
When an outage is detected, we will send you an alert via email, SMS, or Custom Webhooks.

Our Devices allow you to segment your network and monitor each segment individually. This allows you to quickly identify the source of the outage and take action to resolve it.
